## Cypress Steps:
1) The code was build using a standalone Cypress zip installation, and not an npm install. Hence it only contains the code files.
2) You can either install a standalone Cypress zip download through cypress.io, open Cypress.exe, and open the folder manually.
3) Or, you can copy these files in any existing project that has cypress installed, and then test it.
4) There are no dependencies, except cypress.
